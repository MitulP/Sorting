# Sorting

Sorting is essential task to manage data and here we sorts data using python

Here are some of the basic sorting algorithms implemented using python in a simple way.

1) Merge Sort
   Merge sort is a sorting technique based on divide and conquer technique. With worst-case time complexity being Ο(n log n), it is one of the most respected algorithms. 
2) Bubble Sort
   Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm. This sorting algorithm is comparison-based algorithm in which each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order. This algorithm is not suitable for large data sets as its average and worst case complexity are of Ο(n2) where n is the number of items.
